# Tech Case Frontend

# Deployment

The project is deployed and accessible here:
ðŸ”— https://tech-case-xbk8.vercel.app/

The deployed version runs on Vercel, using the latest build from the master branch.

This project is a Next.js + React + Tailwind + Shadcn UI application for patient management. The backend is simulated; all data interactions are handled locally or via mock APIs.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DamianIanni/tech-case.git
cd tech-case
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Node.js (v18+) and npm installed.

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Application Locally

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Credentials:

    emai: admin@aisel.com,
    password: admin123,
    role: "admin",

    email: employee@aisel.com,
    password: employee123,
    role: employee,

    email: "manager@aisel.com",
    password: "manager123",
    role: "manager",

### 4. Simulated Backend

No backend setup is required. All API calls are simulated using local mocks and utilities. You can find mock API logic in `src/app/api/simulatedAPI/` and related files.

### 5. Running Tests

Unit tests are written with Jest and React Testing Library:

```bash
npm test
```

### 6. Project Structure

- `src/` â€” Main application code
- `src/components/` â€” Reusable UI components
- `src/app/` â€” Next.js app routes and pages
- `src/hooks/` â€” Custom React hooks
- `src/lib/` â€” Utilities and test helpers
- `src/constants/` â€” Route and table constants

### 7. Customization

You can modify UI components, forms, and hooks to fit your needs. All logic is frontend-only and easy to extend.

### 8. Note on Data Persistence

This project uses local .json files to simulate a database.
All write operations (create, edit, delete) work correctly in the development environment. However, in production, the file system is read-only, so changes will not be persisted.

### Future Improvements

- Implement a real backend to support data persistence in production.
- Add user authentication and role-based access with real API integration.
